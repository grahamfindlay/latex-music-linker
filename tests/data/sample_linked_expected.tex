JID's \href{https://album.link/i/1832251919}{\textit{God Does Like Ugly}} (2025). So great was my anticipation for this album, that when it dropped at 12:00am ET, I was one of the first couple hundred people to stream it. Is deserves an honorable mention, but I was hoping for something else. I liked the \href{https://youtu.be/GhOUB6IGs6Y?si=S2em8dE2DoMdXtDY}{freestyle} that announced the album more than most of the stuff on the album itself. If you live near any major roads, it is possible that you have already heard \href{https://song.link/i/1812517950}{``Gz''}, because the bass on it so heavy that it can travel miles, penetrate the walls a bunker, and still cause your bones to vibrate.
